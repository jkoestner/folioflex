## Installation

### Local Install
To install, this repository can be installed by running the following command in 
the environment of choice.

```
pip install folioflex
```

Other options can be installed if using more functionality

```
pip install folioflex
pip install folioflex[dev]    # if needing to develop or lint
``````

Or could be done using GitHub.

```
pip install git+https://github.com/jkoestner/folioflex.git
```

If wanting to do more and develop on the code, the following command can be run to install the packages in the requirements.txt file.

```
pip install -e .
pip install -e .[dev]
```

### Docker Install
The package can also be run in docker which provides a containerized environment, and can host the web dashboard.

To run the web dashboard there are a few prerequisites.
  - Docker
  - Redis
  - Worker
  - Flower (optional)

The following can be used in a `docker-compose.yml`. 

```bash
version: "3.8"
services:
  folioflex-web:
    image: dmbymdt/folioflex:latest
    container_name: folioflex-web
    command: gunicorn -b 0.0.0.0:8001 folioflex.dashboard.app:server
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      FFX_CONFIG_PATH: /code/folioflex/configs
    ports:
      - '8001:8001'
    volumes:
      - $DOCKERDIR/folioflex-web/configs:/code/folioflex/configs
```

The docker container has a configuration file that can read in environment variables or
could specify within file. 

There is also an environment variable that can specify the path to the configuration folder.

<details>
  <summary>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</summary>

  <table>
      <tr>
          <th>Variable</th>
          <th>Description</th>
          <th>Default</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>FFX_CONFIG_PATH</td>
          <td>The path to the configuration folder</td>
          <td>folioflex/folioflex/configs</td>
      </tr>
  </table>
</details>

## Usage

### CLI

CLI can be used for easier commands of python scripts for both portfolio or manager. An example of a CLI command is shown below.

```commandline
ffx email --email_list "['yourname@outlook.com']" --heatmap_market {}
```

### Python

When using the portfolio class, the following code can be used to get the returns of a portfolio.

```python
from folioflex.portfolio.portfolio import Portfolio
config_path = "portfolio_demo.yml"
pf = Portfolio(
    config_path=config_path, 
    portfolio='company_a'
)
pf.get_performance()
```

### Web Dashboard - Invest

A demo of the app can be seen at https://invest.koestner.fun/.


It also can be run locally by going to the project root folder and running below.
There are a number of environment variables listed in constants to be able to run locally. 

```python
python -m folioflex.dashboard.app
```

### Plaid Dashboard

A separate dashboard can be run for transaction aggregation.

The transactions are sourced from [Plaid](https://plaid.com/). To be able to use the dashboard
there needs to be one other service:
- **folioflex db**: this is holding the data

The [Plaid Pattern](https://github.com/plaid/pattern) repository was used as a reference
for the docker-compose setup.

```bash
  folioflex-db:
    container_name: folioflex-db
    image: postgres:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - $DOCKERDIR/folioflex/database/init:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d
      - $DOCKERDIR/folioflex/data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    ports:
      - $PLAID_DB_PORT:5432
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: postgres
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: $PLAID_POSTGRES
```

## Other Tools
### Jupyter Lab Usage

To have conda environments work with Jupyter Notebooks a kernel needs to be defined. This can be done defining a kernel, shown below when
in the conda environment.

```
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=folioflex
```
### Logging

If wanting to get more detail in output of messages the logging can increased
```python
from folioflex.utils import config_helper
config_helper.set_log_level("DEBUG")
```

### Coverage

To see the test coverage the following command is run in the root directory.
```
pytest --cov=folioflex --cov-report=html
```
